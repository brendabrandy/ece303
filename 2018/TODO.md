## Test

1. Open two terminals
2. In first terminal, run `python new_receiver.py`
3. In second terminal, run `python new_sender.py`
4. Receiver should go on forever, while sender will end


## Todo list
* Flow Control
* Ending Data transmission
* Go-Back-N in case of packet swap
* Multiple sender multiple receiver

## Notable Stuff
* Error detection
* Checksum calculation
* Timeouts for packet drops
